## Instructions and models

You can find the XML model files in the [models](/models) folder of this repo, and instructions in PDF format in the [instructions](/instructions) folder.

## Obtaining the bricks

In order to build your logo, you're going to need to buy some bricks. You can find the required files in the [models](/models) folder of this repository.

Once you have the required model file, you need to place an order with a brick supplier, we've found [BrickLink](https://www.bricklink.com/) to be a really good site for finding suppliers and sellers. As BrickLink is a marketplace for multiple sellers the interface and terminology can be a bit confusing for first-time users. The following instructions lead you through the steps to find a seller and place an order. In this example, we found a supplier for the JS logo for just Â£1.88.

To order your bricks, sign up for a BrickLink account, then [upload a Wanted List](https://www.bricklink.com/v2/wanted/upload.page) using one of our model files:

![wanted list](/ordering/wanted-list.png)

The model files in this repo are supplied as BrickLink XML files, so you need to select the *Upload BrickLink XML format* option. We also recommend creating a new wanted list, otherwise the parts get added to your default list. Copy and paste the XML into the input field:

![upload wanted list](/ordering/upload-wanted-list.png)

Click *Proceed to verify items* to verify your parts:

![verify items](/ordering/verify-list.png)

Once verified, you have your own wanted list. To buy them, click that big green 'Buy All' button:

![buy all](/ordering/buy-all.png)

BrickLink will search for suppliers worldwide, as this is a relatively small order, you might want to filter to only include suppliers within your own country:

![find supplier](/ordering/find-supplier.png)

Selecting a supplier results in a cart being created:

![create cart](/ordering/create-cart.png)

Following this, it's a pretty standard checkout process.

## Designing your own logos

Here are some simple notes that help you design, build and share your own logos. Feel free to create a pull request if you'd like your creation added to the site.

 - We use the [mecabricks 3D designed](https://www.mecabricks.com/en/workshop) to create the logos.
 - In order to share them, you need to make your creation public. Go to you [library page](https://www.mecabricks.com/en/account/library), double-click on one of your models, and under *properties* select *Open to the public*
 - Save this, then look under the *Links* tab to find a unique URL for your model
 - To obtain the bricklink XML file, navigate to this public URL, then select the *INVENTORY* tab underneath the 3D rendering.
