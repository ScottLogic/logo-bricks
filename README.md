## Obtaining the bricks

In order to build your favourite web technology logo, you're going to need to buy some bricks. This is actually quite straightforward, there are a number of standard formats for brick inventory. You can find the required files in the [models](/models) folder of this repository.

Once you have the required model file, you need to place an order with a brick supplier, we've found [BrickLink](https://www.bricklink.com/) to be a really good site for finding suppliers and sellers. As BrickLink is a marketplace for multiple sellers the interface and terminology can be a bit confusing for first-time users. The following instructions lead you through the steps to find a seller and place an order. In this example, we found a supplier for the JS Logo for just Â£1.88.

To order your bricks, sign up for a BrickLink account, then [upload a Wanted List](https://www.bricklink.com/v2/wanted/upload.page) using one of our model files:

Once uploaded you'll see the list of items in order to verify them:

Once verified, you have your own wanted list. To buy them, click that big green 'Buy All' button:

BrickLink will search for suppliers worldwide, as this is a relatively small order, you might want to filter to only include suppliers within your own country:

Selecting a supplier results in a cart being created:

Following this, it's a pretty standard checkout process.
